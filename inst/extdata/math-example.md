title: An example with math elements
---


This example has $\LaTeX$ elements embedded in the
text. It is intended to demonstrate that m$\alpha\tau$h
mode can work with tinkr. $y = 
mx + b$

Here is an example from the mathjax website:

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
\[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.\]


When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are

```latex
$$
x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}
$$
```


$$
x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}
$$

Below is an example from https://github.com/ropensci/tinkr/issues/38

$$
Q_{N(norm)}=\frac{C_N +C_{N-1}}2\times 
\frac{\sum _{i=N-n}^{N}Q_i} {\sum_{j=N-n}^{N}{(\frac{C_j+C_{j-1}}2)}}
$$
