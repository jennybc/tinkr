\description{
Commonmark treats reference-style links as regular links, which can be a
pain when converting large documents. This is an attempt at resolving these
links by reading in the source document, finding the relative links, and
adding them back with the 'asis' attribute.

f <- system.file("extdata", "link-test.md", package = "tinkr")
